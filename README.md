# Release Protect Authenticator

## Overview

Release Protect Authenticator is a decentralized access management and release protection smart contract designed to provide secure, granular control over digital resource access and verification.

### Key Features

- Flexible access level management
- Verifiable release tokens
- Controlled resource access
- Secure permission management

## Problem Solved

In complex digital ecosystems, managing access to sensitive resources and releases can be challenging. Release Protect Authenticator provides a blockchain-native solution for:

- Controlling access to digital resources
- Creating verifiable release tokens
- Implementing multi-tier permission systems
- Ensuring secure, transparent access management

## Technical Architecture

The contract uses a comprehensive mapping system to track:
- Release details
- Access tokens
- Permission levels
- Verification mechanisms

### Core Components

- `releases`: Maps release identifiers to detailed release information
- `access-tokens`: Tracks individual access permissions
- `verification-roles`: Manages authorized verifiers

## Security Considerations

- Immutable access controls
- Principal-based authorization
- Explicit verification requirements
- Granular permission management

## Usage Example

```clarity
;; Example of creating a restricted release
(create-release 
  "product-v1.0" 
  access-level-restricted 
  (some contract-owner)
)

;; Example of granting access token
(grant-access-token 
  "product-v1.0" 
  tx-sender 
  u30  ;; 30-day access
)
```

## Getting Started

1. Install Clarinet
2. Clone the repository
3. Run `clarinet check` to verify contract
4. Use `clarinet console` for interactions
